## Notes for the other agent

**2026-06-06 (session 3) — company-category step is now in the prototype.** Added the business-category multi-select to `prototypes/phase-1-onboarding` (company-setup screen): `company_type` lookup (cultivator/wholesaler/importer/pharmacy) + `company_type_assignment` junction, written on company create, matching `SCHEMA-DRAFT`. The control is a click-to-open `<details>` dropdown (multi-select; closed bar shows picks). Generalized `loadDB` backfill so older saved state self-heals new tables. **No shared files left locked.** Commits `9c08c8c` + `ad69f8c`.

**Path B (join-existing) — build-deferral posture recorded in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-06).** We ship **Path A only** in v0; the `join_request` table + approval + screens are deferred (all additive later — a new table breaks nothing). **Two invariants we must honor in v0 code regardless — relevant to your `src/` + RLS work:** (1) `person.company_id` stays **nullable** and is read through ONE accessor (e.g. `currentCompany()`), not scattered; (2) **RLS must fail safe on a null `company_id`** (a company-less user sees only their own rows). Rationale: the company-less state already exists in the sign-in→company-setup window; Path B just makes it last longer.

**Open design Q (adjacent to your Connect work):** where does a Superadmin review/approve pending join requests? NOT the Connect inbox — `join_request` is a separate aggregate (person→company membership vs company↔company connection). Noted in `DECISIONS.md`, not yet in Linear.

Still on my list: `pending_inbox_item` `request_type` + `assigned_to` (awaiting your 5 answers); refresh `schema-phase1-visual.html` + first migrations; A2 `email_encrypted` scan (PR #25); AWS Bedrock access.

Going offline.
